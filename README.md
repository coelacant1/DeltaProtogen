# Delta Protogen

------------------------------------------
Coela Can't! Delta Protogen V1
Document Version: V1.0
------------------------------------------

Included are all of the STL files pre-oriented and ready for printing. But what about the visor? Well, two versions of the vacuum forming buck are included as well so you have the ability to make your own PETG visors. Don't forget that the 3D STEP and IGES CAD files are included, so if the design is not exactly what you want then you have the ability to modify and tweak it!

This design is built around printing on the Prusa i3 MK3s with build dimensions of X:250mm, Y:210mm, and Z:210mm. This design can be printed on smaller printers but may need to be modified or split requiring glue or the addition of screw mounts.

M2 Screws (For Custom LED panels): https://www.amazon.com/uxcell-M2x6mm-Thread-Button-Socket/dp/B01B1OD9UQ/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3FN0QLAWPNBSN&keywords=m2x6+screws&qid=1642454542&sprefix=m2x6+screws%2Caps%2C74&sr=8-3

The frame will bolt together with the use of M3 hardware, almost entirely with M3x8mm/10mm, ensure the screws are not protruding.
The top hinge is mounted with M5 threaded inserts and the hinge mechanism uses an M5 threaded insert and an M5x30mm bolt.
The rear latches are mounted with M3 threaded inserts and M3x10mm screws and use M5x8mm bolts with 20mm M5 grub screws.

VISOR
------------------------------------------
Print the V1 or V2 Buck
Make a vacuum former tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx66mS7U2vY
Material: Use 0.04" or 1.0mm PETG for proper thickness 

Magnetic mounts visor mount should be attached with a form of adhesive - double sided tape or epoxy - careful with super glue on the visor though! It will cloud it up. Use 6mmx2mm neodymium magnets and check the direction: https://www.amazon.com/FINDMAG-Refrigerator-Magnets-Premium-Whiteboard/dp/B075RZ82HP/ref=sr_1_4?crid=2HQ1A21Y0QQG&keywords=magnet+100+pack+6mm&qid=1645489808&sprefix=magnet+100+pack+6mm%2Caps%2C75&sr=8-4

3D Printing
------------------------------------------
Recommended build dimensions: 250mmx210mmx210mm
Resolution: 0.2mm or higher quality
Supports: Depending on the overhang capabilities with your build plate, most require no support. The jaw requires a raft. Top head/forehead requires support.
Brim: Depending on your build surface a brim may be needed to bed adhesion
Material: PETG for frame and PVB for transparent side display covers - PLA can be used but it can melt if left in hot areas or in vehicles
